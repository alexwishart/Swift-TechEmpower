# PerfectTemplate
Perfect Empty Starter Project

This repository holds a blank Perfect project which can be cloned to serve as a starter for new work. It builds with Swift Package Manager and produces a stand-alone HTTP executable.

**The master branch of this project currently compiles with *DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-06-20-a* released June 20th, 2016 using Swift Package Manager.**

Ensure that you have installed the few dependencies which Perfect requires for your platform:

[Dependencies](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect/wiki/Dependencies)

## Building & Running

The following will clone and build an empty starter project and launch the server on port 8181.

```
git clone https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate.git
cd PerfectTemplate
swift build
.build/debug/PerfectTemplate
```

You should see the following output:

```
Starting HTTP server on 0.0.0.0:8181 with document root ./webroot
```

This means the server is running and waiting for connections. Access [http://localhost:8181/](http://127.0.0.1:8181/) to see the greeting. Hit control-c to terminate the server.

## Starter Content

The template file contains a very simple "hello, world!" example.

```swift
import PerfectLib

// Initialize base-level services
PerfectServer.initializeServices()

// Create our webroot
// This will serve all static content by default
let webRoot = "./webroot"
try Dir(webRoot).create()

// Add our routes and such
// Register your own routes and handlers
Routing.Routes["/"] = {
    request, response in
    
    response.appendBody(string: "<html><title>Hello, world!</title><body>Hello, world!</body></html>")
    response.requestCompleted()
}

do {
    
    // Launch the HTTP server on port 8181
    try HTTPServer(documentRoot: webRoot).start(port: 8181)
    
} catch PerfectError.NetworkError(let err, let msg) {
    print("Network error thrown: \(err) \(msg)")
}
```

## Repository Layout

We have finished refactoring Perfect to support Swift Package Manager. The Perfect project has been split up into the following repositories:

* [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) - This repository contains the core PerfectLib and will continue to be the main landing point for the project.
* [PerfectTemplate](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate) - A simple starter project which compiles with SPM into a stand-alone executable HTTP server. This repository is ideal for starting on your own Perfect based project.
* [PerfectDocs](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs) - Contains all API reference related material.
* [PerfectExamples](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectExamples) - All the Perfect example projects and documentation.
* [PerfectEverything](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectEverything) - This umbrella repository allows one to pull in all the related Perfect modules in one go, including the servers, examples, database connectors and documentation. This is a great place to start for people wishing to get up to speed with Perfect.
* [PerfectServer](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectServer) - Contains the PerfectServer variants, including the stand-alone HTTP and FastCGI servers. Those wishing to do a manual deployment should clone and build from this repository.
* [Perfect-Redis](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis) - Redis database connector.
* [Perfect-SQLite](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-SQLite) - SQLite3 database connector.
* [Perfect-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-PostgreSQL) - PostgreSQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MySQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL) - MySQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MongoDB](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MongoDB) - MongoDB database connector.
* [Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4) - Apache 2.4 FastCGI module; required for the Perfect FastCGI server variant.

The database connectors are all stand-alone and can be used outside of the Perfect framework and server.
